# CVEdB
Yet Another Open Source vulnerability database

to run the repo successfully you have to find Vulners API key and VulDB API Key and put them in exploit_link.py and exploit_price.py files respectively

to install all dependencies, run 
> *pip install -r requirements.txt*. 

For a cleaner usage, make a virtualenv and then install the depenendecies. 

After installing the dependencies, run the flask app. 
> py ./app.py - *Windows*

Then visit the localhost link the flask app provides.

Will upload it somewhere in the future or not, idk.
